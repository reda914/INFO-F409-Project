\section{Introduction}
This document represents a template for the Paper reproduction report for the courses \textit{Learning dynamics} (ULB) and \textit{Computational Game Theory} (VUB).

The information concerning the report is available either on Canvas for the VUB students or UV for the ULB students

The total length of this document must not exceed 10 pages, including references.  Appendices can be added if students consider this useful.

In this section you describe what the paper you are aiming to reproduce is about, what their main contributions are and why they claim the results are important. The information should be sufficient so that one does not read the original paper in order to understand these three points. Add the reference of the original paper in the bibliography and cite it in the text where necessary.  


Add all bibliographical references in the bib file and cite the papers in the latex file.  You can obtain the bibtex entries from google scholar but check if they are complete;You need to provide
\begin{itemize}
    \item for journal papers :  author names, year of publication, title, journal name, volume, and pages. use "@article"
    \item for conference publications:  author names, year , title, conference proceedings title, pages, location. use "@inproceedings".
\end{itemize}
See the examples on the bib file. 

\textbf{Do not put arxiv papers in the bibliography as they correspond either  to work that has not been peer reviewed or there is an official version published in a journal of conference.  In case of the latter, add the reference to the published article. If you want to refer to an arxiv paper for some reason,  or to some website, use footnotes.}
