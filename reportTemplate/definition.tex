\section{Practical aspects of the reproduction}
Report what was needed to be done to reproduce the paper.  

If code existed, explain how (or not) it was useful.  What you needed to do to make it work or how you adapted it in any way.

If no code is available, provide insight into how you organized the implementation to get to the results.  You can provide your implementations as an additional zip file.  

Report on any difficulties in terms of clarity in the paper or where you had to make choices because some information was missing in the original work (don't forget to check if any supplementary information is available with the paper).

If you made any additional data analysis or tests make sure to report them.
